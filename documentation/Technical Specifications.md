   - Schema:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    WORKBOOK {
        string id
        string name
        string owner_id
        datetime created_at
        datetime modified_at
        object settings
    }
    USER {
        string id
        string email
        string name
        object preferences
    }
    COLLABORATION {
        string workbook_id

```

2. Blob Storage (Azure Blob Storage)
   - Purpose: Store actual workbook content and large datasets
   - Organization: Container per user, blob per workbook

3. Cache (Azure Redis Cache)
   - Purpose: Store frequently accessed data and session information
   - Key-value pairs for quick retrieval of workbook metadata and user settings

4. Relational Database (Azure SQL Database)
   - Purpose: Store structured data for reporting, analytics, and complex queries
   - Schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE UserActivity (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(50),
    workbook_id VARCHAR(50),
    action_type VARCHAR(20),
    timestamp DATETIME
);

CREATE TABLE FeatureUsage (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    feature_name VARCHAR(50),
    usage_count INT,
    last_used DATETIME
);
```

## API DESIGN

Microsoft Excel will expose a RESTful API for integration with other systems and to support the web and mobile applications. The API will follow OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications.

Key API endpoints:
